This program reads in a list of students' gpas and score on their gre. It uses a k means clustering algorithm to cluster the data. The clusters group the individuals into NUM_OF_CLUSTERS groups based on their respective tests scores. This analyzation can be used in many ways, such as to predict the group of people who are most likely to go to the best medical school, or how to distribute honors amongst a graduating class.

Adjust the number of cluster groups by changing the value of NUM_OF_CLUSTERS on line 88.

To run the program, run 'python api.py' in the appropriate directory in your terminal.
